# Markowitz Portfolio theory - 
This optimization model is based on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). “According to the theory, investment’s risk and return 
characteristics should not be viewed alone, but should be evaluated by how the investment affects the overall portfolio’s risk 
and return. MPT shows that an investor can construct a portfolio of multiple assets that will maximize returns for a given level of risk.”

# How clustering helps in selection of the stock
Cluster analysis is a technique used to group sets of objects that share similar characteristics. It is common in statistics. 
Investors will use cluster analysis to develop a cluster trading approach that helps them build a diversified portfolio. 
Stocks that exhibit high correlations in returns fall into one basket, those slightly less correlated in another, 
and so on, until each stock is placed into a category.

## Key points how clustering helps in stock selection
1. Cluster analysis helps investors develop a cluster trading approach that builds a diversified portfolio of investments.
2. Cluster analysis enables investors to buy and cluster assets with related returns that fit different market segments.
3. One of the benefits of cluster analysis is to help protect the investor's portfolio against systemic risks that could 
make the portfolio vulnerable to losses.
4. One criticism of cluster analysis is that clusters with a high correlation in returns sometimes share similar risk factors,
meaning that weak performance in one cluster could translate to weak performance in another.

# Efficient Frontier
From the plot of the randomly simulated portfolios, we can see it forms a shape of an arch line on the top of clustered blue dots. 
This line is called efficient frontier. Why is it efficient? Because points along the line will give you the lowest risk for a given 
target return. All the other dots right to the line will give you higher risk with same returns. If the expected returns are the same,
why would you take an extra risk when there’s an option with lower risk?

The way we found the optimal portfolio was by simulating many possible random choices and 
pick the best ones (either minimum risk or maximum risk-adjusted return).
